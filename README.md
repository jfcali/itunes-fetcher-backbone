Adaptation of original [iTunes Fetcher](https://github.com/jfcali/itunes-fetcher). This time, using Backbone.

The project was bootstrapped using this [repo](https://github.com/jfcali/vanillajs-boilerplate).

## Scripts:

- Use `npm install` to install dependencies
- Use `npm start` to start a local dev server
- Use `npm run build` to generate production ready static HTML, JS and CSS files, located in `./dist`.
